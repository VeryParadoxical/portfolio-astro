# My portfolio site built using ðŸš€

This site is intended as both a learning experience, and as a way to get a high performance, accessible, responsive, and SEO-friendly website!

I am open to PRs - though given the nature of the site, it is unlikely I'll accept them without a thorough review.

However, I am very open to any suggestions of how this site may be improved, or general tips for the future.

Astro is pretty cool, but I am definitely on the greener side with it!
